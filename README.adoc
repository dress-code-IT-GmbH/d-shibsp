# Shibboleth SP docker image  

A Shibboleth configuration running apache httpd and shibd in a container:

1. Mapping users (apache and shibd) between host & container filesystems (useful in a shared process namespace)
2. The user-defined network uses static IP addresses
3. Image is based on centos7
4. The image produces immutable containers, i.e. a container can be removed and re-created
   any time without loss of data, because data is stored on mounted volumes

## Prepare the repository

    git clone https://github.com/identinetics/docker-shib-sp.git
    cd docker-shib-sp
    git submodule update --init
    

## Build the docker image

    cp conf.sh.default conf.sh
    # edit conf.sh: set SERVICEDESCRIPTION, IMGID,
    ./dscripts/build.sh 


## Configure and start the container
 
First, start the container with a shell.
This will initialize the persistent docker volumes without starting the services.

    ./dscripts/run.sh -ip bash 

Then configure httpd and shibboleth (see next section).
Once the configuration is completed run `/start.sh` in the container, or restart the container:

    ./dscripts/run.sh              # start container in daemon mode
    ./dscripts/manage.sh logs      # show container stdout and stderr
    ./dscripts/manage.sh logfiles  # list log files as configured in conf.sh

### Configuration Options

There are several good guides available, such as on shibboleth.net and switch.ch
This repository includes a simple default configuration for an SP.
To make it operational following contants need to be replaced:

|---
| File            | Element                    | sample value                              | to be replaced with
| httpd.conf      | User                       | httpd                                     | conf*.sh/$HTTPDUSER
| shibboleth2.xml | entityID                   | https://sp.example.org/sp                 | https://mdreg.portalverbund.gv.at/sp
| shibboleth2.xml | SP hostname                | sp.example.org |mdreg.portalverbund.gv.at |
| shibboleth2.xml | Metadata feed              | http://mdfeed.federation.org/metadata.xml | http://mdfeed.portalverbund.gv.at/metadata.xml
| shibboleth2.xml | External Discovery Service | https://disco.federation.org/role/idp.ds  | https://disco.portalverbund.gv.at/role/idp.ds
|---

    
## HTTPD Configuration

- The default apache httpd configuration is created in /etc/httpd during docker build
- In conf/httpd.conf:
  -- Set "User" to $HTTPDUSER as defined in conf*.sh
  -- Keep the directive "Group shibd"
- If the apache httpd is not internet facing, setup the reverse proxy/load balancer; otherwise configure TLS
- In conf/httpd.conf:


## Shibboleth SP Configuration


The default shibd configuration is created in /etc/shibboleth during docker build.
Check/modify the config files in /etc/shibboleth according to the documentation, in particular:

  - attribute-map.xml and attribute-policy.xml
  - shibboleth2.xml
  - new keys must be created manually (inside the container)
  
    `su - $SHIBDUSER`
    `cd /etc/shibboleth`
    `./keygen.sh -f -u $SHIBDUSER -g shibd -y 10 -h $HOSTNAME -e $ENTITYID`
    
  - generate and edit the SP metadata according to your federation policy; then submit it to the registry.
  
    `bash ./metagen.sh -c sp-cert.pem -h idp.example.org -e https://idp.example.org/sp > metadata_to_be_edited.xml`


### Duplicating/migrating an existing configuration

An existing configuration might be duplicated on the same or migrated to another node.

- copy conf.sh (or confXX.sh to confYY.sh on the same node)
- edit conf.sh and set the IMGID and PROJSHORT
- dscripts/build.sh (this will also create the docker volumes)
- the default path for the volumes is $DOCKER_VOLUME_ROOT/$CONTAINERNAME, here in short VOLROOT
- copy the contents of the docker volumes from the existing instance
- edit VOLROOT/.etc_httpd_conf/httpd.conf and correct the user
- set servername, docroot and logfile path in VOLROOT/.etc_httpd_conf.d/vhost.conf
- Adapt shibboleth2.xml, attribute-map.xml and attribute-policy.xml in VOLROOT.etc_shibboleth/ 
- create a new sp key and metadata:
 
    `dscripts/run.sh -i  # start container in interactive mode`
    `cd /etc/shibboleth; ./keygen.sh -f`
    `chown shibd-user sp-*`
    `metagen.sh`
    
- edit metadata and submit it to the metadata feed
- copy the metadata signing key to VOLROOT.etc_shibboleth/metadata_crt.pem (as defined in shibboleth2.xml)
- edit static contents in VOLROOT.var_www
- Besides the SP configuration the load balancer, TLS-certificate and DNS-name need to be configured
