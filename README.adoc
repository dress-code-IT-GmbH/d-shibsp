# Shibboleth SP docker image  

A Shibboleth configuration running apache httpd and shibd in a container, featuring:

1. Image is based on centos7
2. The (optional) express configuration uses a single YAML file to setup a shibboleth SP.
3. The container is executed with reduced kernel capabilities

## Prepare the repository

    git clone https://github.com/identinetics/docker-shib-sp.git
    cd docker-shib-sp
    git submodule update --init
    

## Build the docker image

    cp conf.sh.default conf.sh
    # edit conf.sh: set SERVICEDESCRIPTION, IMGID,
    ./dscripts/build.sh 


## Initialize the container's persistent volumes
 
First, start the container with a shell.
This will initialize the docker volumes without starting the services.

    ./dscripts/run.sh -iCp bash

Now the container is initialized, but does not have a complete httpd and shibboleth configuration.

### Basic configuration

#### Standard configuration

Using `/etc/httpd/*.orig` and  `etc/shibboleth/shibboleth2.xml.dist` follow a standard config procdeure.
There are several good guides for a general Shibboleth SP available, such as on shibboleth.net or https://www.switch.ch/aai/guides/sp/[switch.ch].

#### Express configuration

As an alternative this repository includes an express configuration for the SP.
By editing express_setup.yaml the basic httpd+shibd configuration can be controlled from a single place.
The setup can be run only once after creating persistent docker volumes. Manual editing afterwards is possible.
To prepare the express setup, make an edited copy of `/opt/install/config/express_setup.yaml` in `/opt/etc/`.
This is a persistent volume and can be used to repeat the express configuration.
Then run:

    /opt/install/scripts/express_setup.sh


## Shibboleth SP further configuration

Check/modify the config files in /etc/shibboleth according to the documentation, in particular:

  - register /etc/shibboleth/export/sp_metadata.xml at the federation resource registry
  - copy the metadata signing key to /etc/shibboleth/metadata_crt.pem
  - attribute-map.xml and attribute-policy.xml (e.g. if Profile is set to 'default')


## Start the container in operational mode

    ./dscripts/run.sh              # start container in daemon mode
    ./dscripts/manage.sh logs      # show container stdout and stderr (showing critical errors during startup)
    ./dscripts/manage.sh logfiles  # list log files as configured in conf.sh (more in /var/log/)


### Duplicating/migrating an existing configuration

An existing configuration might be duplicated on the same or migrated to another node.

- copy conf.sh (or confXX.sh to confYY.sh on the same node)
- edit conf.sh and set the IMGID and PROJSHORT
- dscripts/build.sh (this will also create the docker volumes)
- the default path for the volumes is $DOCKER_VOLUME_ROOT/$CONTAINERNAME, here in short VOLROOT
- copy the contents of the docker volumes from the existing instance
- edit VOLROOT/.etc_httpd_conf/httpd.conf and correct the user
- set servername, docroot and logfile path in VOLROOT/.etc_httpd_conf.d/vhost.conf
- Adapt shibboleth2.xml, attribute-map.xml and attribute-policy.xml in VOLROOT.etc_shibboleth/ 
- create a new sp key and metadata:
 
    `dscripts/run.sh -i  # start container in interactive mode`
    `cd /etc/shibboleth; ./keygen.sh -f`
    `chown shibd-user sp-*`
    `metagen.sh`
    
- edit metadata and submit it to the metadata feed
- copy the metadata signing key to VOLROOT.etc_shibboleth/metadata_crt.pem (as defined in shibboleth2.xml)
- edit static contents in VOLROOT.var_www
- Besides the SP configuration the load balancer, TLS-certificate and DNS-name need to be configured
